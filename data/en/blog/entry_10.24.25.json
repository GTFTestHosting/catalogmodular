    "paragraph": "When it comes to tortillas, the question “Is this bread?” sparks surprisingly heated debates. On one hand, tortillas share many characteristics with bread—they’re made from flour or corn, water, and sometimes yeast or baking powder, and they serve as a staple carbohydrate in meals. For those who define bread broadly as any baked or cooked dough, tortillas certainly fit the bill.<br><br>However, others argue tortillas aren’t true bread. Unlike traditional loaves, tortillas are unleavened (most of the time), thin, and flexible rather than fluffy or crusty. They’re also often cooked on a griddle rather than baked in an oven, which some purists say sets them apart.<br><br>In the end, whether tortillas are bread might depend more on how you define bread than on the tortilla itself. Either way, whether wrapped, rolled, or stacked, tortillas remain a beloved staple around the world—bread or not!"
