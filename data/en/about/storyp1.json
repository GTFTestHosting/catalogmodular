    "paragraph": "Our origins trace back to 1967 in a dedicated, tight-knit Hispanic community in the San Fernando Valley, where the air was filled with the aromas of home-cooked meals and the streets echoed with laughter and conversation. It was a place where families gathered around wooden tables, sharing stories and passing plates of freshly made food, and where the humble tortilla held a place of honor in every meal. Inspired by this vibrant culture and a deep respect for tradition, Graciana Tortilla was born to capture the essence of these cherished moments and bring them to more tables across the neighborhood."
