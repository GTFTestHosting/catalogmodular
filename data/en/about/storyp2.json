    "paragraph": "Graciana Tortilla was initially established to provide tortillas to our own restaurants and to nearby eateries that shared our passion for authentic flavors. From the very first batch, each tortilla was handcrafted with intention, pressed gently to achieve the perfect balance of softness and structure, and made with ingredients chosen for their natural quality and authenticity. It wasn’t just about feeding people—it was about preserving a culinary heritage, creating a product that carried the warmth, care, and pride of our community into every bite, and connecting people to a shared sense of home and tradition."
